Explain where Diffie-Hellman is used:

TLS Handshake: Diffie-Hellman (often in its Elliptic Curve form, ECDH) is fundamental to establishing a shared secret key during the Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake (the process that secures HTTPS connections). When your browser connects to a secure website, DH/ECDH allows the browser and server to agree on a symmetric key for encrypting the session data, even if an attacker is listening to the initial communication. They exchange public keys over the insecure channel and independently derive the same shared secret.
Secure Messaging (e.g., Signal Protocol): Protocols like Signal use variations of Diffie-Hellman (like the Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman, X3DH) to establish secure end-to-end encrypted communication channels. It allows users to derive shared keys for encrypting messages without relying on a central server knowing those keys, providing forward secrecy and other security properties.

Mention why it's important for secure communication:

Diffie-Hellman's primary importance lies in its ability to allow two parties, who have never met or shared secrets before, to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. An eavesdropper listening to the exchange (who sees the public parameters and the public keys being exchanged) cannot easily compute the final shared secret key (this relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem).

This shared secret can then be used as a key (or to derive keys) for symmetric encryption (like AES), which is much faster than asymmetric encryption for bulk data. This enables secure communication sessions (like HTTPS) or encrypted messaging without pre-sharing keys.
