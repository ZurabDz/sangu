**Explanation:**

Code obfuscation is the process of modifying source code or machine code to make it harder for humans to understand, analyze, or reverse-engineer, while still ensuring the code functions correctly. It is *not* encryption, as the code is still directly executable.

*   **Manual Obfuscation Used:**
    *   **Type:** Identifier Renaming. We replaced meaningful function names (`factorial`), parameters (`n`), and local variables (`result`, `i`) with short, meaningless names (`_f0`, `a`, `b`, `c`). We also removed comments and docstrings. The error message was slightly changed (`E1`).
    *   **Why:** This is the simplest form of obfuscation. It deters casual reading and makes understanding the code's logic and purpose slightly more time-consuming without specialized tools. It's easy to apply but also relatively easy to reverse with careful analysis or automated refactoring tools. It offers minimal protection against determined reverse-engineering.

*   **Automatic Obfuscation (Simulated):**
    *   **Type:** The simulation primarily demonstrates more **Aggressive Identifier Renaming** (using names like `_x1a_2f`, `a_zA_Z0_9`, `_O0O`, `_I1I`, `_l1l`, `_oOo_` which are intentionally confusing and harder to track) and minor **Whitespace/Layout Modification**. Real automatic tools would often add:
        *   **String Encryption/Encoding:** Hiding literal strings (like error messages) within encoded formats.
        *   **Control Flow Flattening:** Restructuring loops and conditional statements (e.g., using `while` loops with complex state variables instead of simple `for` loops or `if/else` blocks) to obscure the program's execution path.
        *   **Dead Code Insertion:** Adding code that doesn't affect the outcome but increases complexity.
        *   **Code Packing:** Encoding the entire script (e.g., in Base64 or Hex) and wrapping it in a decoder and an `exec` call.
